## About The Project

MovieTime is a **Content-Based Movie Recommender System** that works on the principles on **Unsupervised Machine Learning.** 
<br /><br />
After the EDA and preprocessing of data, it calculates the **cosine similarities** of a given movie with all the other movies present in the dataset and returns **five** movies that are **most similar**.

The **web app** is then built using **Streamlit** and is deployed using **Heroku**.
